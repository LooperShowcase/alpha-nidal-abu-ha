The first cars manufactured by AvtoVAZ were produced with technical assistance from Fiat and marketed
 under the Zhiguli designation. <br>The Lada brand appeared in 1973, initially being overseas-focused before
  becoming AvtoVAZ's main brand for all markets in the 1990s. <br>Renault took control of the brand in 2016. 
  Technical assistance from the French company started in 2008, after it acquired a minority AvtoVAZ stake. <br>
   Lada was re-acquired by the Russian government in 2022.
